	"question": "Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?",
	"answer": "While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly. <br>WHO continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update as new findings are available.",
