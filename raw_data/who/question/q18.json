	"answer": "<*>Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.<*>Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water<*>Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.<*>Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).<*>Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).<*>Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.<*>Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.<*>After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.<*>Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.<*>Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.",
