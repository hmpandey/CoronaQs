	"question": "I am looking after someone who is ill with suspect or confirmed COVID-19. What precautions should I take?",
	"answer": "<*> You should limit the movement around the house of the individual who is ill and minimize shared space.<*> Ensure shared spaces like bathrooms, and the kitchen are well ventilated. One way to do this is by keeping the windows open. Clean and disinfect the bathroom and toilet surface at least once a day using regular household soap or detergent for cleaning and then disinfecting with a regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite.<*>Do not forget the importance of hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand-rub or soap and water (if hands are visibly soiled).<*>Whenever possible, household members should stay in a different room or maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from the ill person.<*> When helping care for the sick individual, wear a tightly fitted medical/surgical mask that covers your nose and mouth when in the same room as the affected individual. Make sure you are careful not to touch your mask. If your mask gets wet or dirty, it should be replaced. When removing a mask, it is important to throw it away and perform hand hygiene. Dispose of any material with respiratory secretions immediately after use.<*> Both the ill individual and you, as the caregiver, should perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions.",
