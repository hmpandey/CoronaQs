    "question": "Can I catch the virus from being in an enclosed space (i.e. bus, subway) in close proximity to someone who doesnâ€™t have respiratory symptoms?",
    "answer": "Since the virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets, the risk of catching it from somebody who is asymptomatic, even a contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, is low. However, in light of the pandemic, everyone should maintain social distancing, which means keeping at least 1 meter away from others, avoiding mass gatherings and areas with large numbers of people, and practicing frequent hand washing and hand sanitizing according to the recommendation.",
