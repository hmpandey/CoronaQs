    "question": "What alternatives do I have if there are no hand sanitizers available? Can I use other alcohol like ethyl or liquor?",
    "answer": "If hand sanitizers are not available, hand washing with soap and water is the recommended, and even better, alternative. Liquor is not effective against coronavirus. For an alcohol-based hand rub to be effective, it must have an alcohol content of 60% to 95%.",
